## Modern Front-end Development with Rails (2nd edition)

Enhance the user experience of a pre-seeded Rails7 application using tools from
- Rails ecosystem (Hotwire, Turbo, Stimulus)
- JavaScript ecosystem (TypeScript, React)
- packaging and asset pipeline (jsbundling-rails with esbuild, css-bundling-rails with Tailwind CSS, Propshaft)

Application Context:
- A music festival webapp, where multiple bands will perform at various concerts. This app contains a schedule of all the concerts and venues.
- Things to be built
  - Schedule Page
  - Concert Display Page

## Progress

1. Set up Rails with TypeScript and basic data modeling. Add views with no interactivity.
2. Use Hotwire and Turbo to add dynamic behavior without actually writing JavaScript.
